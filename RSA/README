This is a simple RSA encryption/decryption CLI tool that supports the following functions:
	-i path Path to the input file
	-o path Path to the output file
	-k path Path to the key file
	-g length Perform RSA key-pair generation given a key length “length”
	-d Decrypt input and store results to output.
	-e Encrypt input and store results to output.
	-a Compare the performance of RSA encryption and decryption with three
	different key lengths (1024, 2048, 4096 key lengths) in terms of computational time.
	-h This help message

To compile and run it use the make command and the makefile will do everything for you :)
