This program runs the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm. To 
simulate true Client-Host communication each "person" runs on a 
seperate thread.
After the key exchange takes place, each thread reports its key 
back to the main() which compares and shows whether they match 
or not returning 0 for a positive match and -1 for a negative.

=========================================================
=                      Compilation                      =
=========================================================

    When compiled the program can take the following flags
        -DDEBUG : Prints statements about each thread and its 
                state to the console. 
        -DVERBOSE   : Prints the various variables used in the
                    algorithm to the console.

    The program is compiled with the following command:
        gcc -o dh_assign_1 DH_Key_exchange.c -lgmp 
            -lpthread -g -DVERBOSE -DDEBUG

    Alternatively, the program can also be compiled through
    the makefile with the following command:
        make

=========================================================
=                       Execution                       =
=========================================================

    The program is run with the following command:
    ./dh [-o filename] [-p prime] [-g base] [-a host_key] [-b client_key]

    Options:
        -o      :   Write the output to the specified file.
        -p      :   Use the specified prime number
        -g      :   Use the specified base number
        -a      :   Use the specified private host key
        -b      :   Use the specified private client key

    if any of {-o,-p,-g,-a,-b} is ommited, the program will 
    select a random number for that option.

    Exit Status:
        0       :   When the two keys match
        -1      :   When the two keys do not match

    Example: (compiled with DVERBOSE flag)
        ./dh_assign_1 -p 23 -g 5 -a 6 -b 15

    The program will then print the following to the console:
        Selected prime number 23
        Selected base number 5
        Selected host private number 6
        Selected client private number 6
        [{3272578816} | Client sent public key: 8]
        [{3264186112} | Host Received public key: 8]
        [{3264186112} | Host sent public key: 8]
        [{3272578816} | Client Received public key: 8]
        Secret key for thread[3264186112]: 13
        Secret key for thread[3272578816]: 13
Keys match

    If the program is compiled without the -DDEBUG flag it will
    not print the statements about each thread and its state.

    If the program is compiled without the -DVERBOSE flag it will
    not print the various variables used in the algorithm.
